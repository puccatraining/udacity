          For this project, you will be writing most of your code in js/app.js. Note that it's very important that you
          plan your project before you start writing any code! Break your project down into small pieces of work and
          strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any
          issues
          that appear.

          This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be
          using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how
          javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of
          what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.
        </p>
        <P>
          For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every
          piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If
          it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you
          wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove
          any debugging code from your final submission.

        <h2>What You Will Build</h2>
        <p>
          You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added
          to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page.
          We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a
          great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with
          JavaScript frameworks.
        </p>
        <P>
          To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way.
          Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section
          rather than giving you the default jump.
        </p>
        <P>
          This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work.
          You’ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you
          find this process to be quick, there’s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to
          improve the users’ experience.

          The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into
          a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to
          combine them in a complex application.

          The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:
        <ul id="idealWF">
          <li>What’s the ideal workflow?</li>
          <li>How many files do I need?</li>
          <li>Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?</li>
          <li>How many JavaScript functions do I need?</li>
          <li>Should my function be this many lines of code?</li>
          <li>Is readability or performance more important?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There’s no single correct answer to each question. While building this project, working with peers, and
          getting feedback from the project reviewer -- you will naturally develop your own answers to these questions!
